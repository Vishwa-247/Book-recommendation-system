                        <p>AdvocateKhoj.com provides lawyers and potential clients with a forum that functions as an
                            open market. AdvocateKhoj.com is not responsible for the content of materials posted on its
                            Web sites. The opinions and views expressed are those of the individual Users of the Service
                            and do not reflect those of AdvocateKhoj.com. Data submitted by other Users (both lawyers
                            and lay persons) is not verified or reviewed in any way before it appears on the
                            AdvocateKhoj.com Web site. The accuracy, completeness or adequacy of AdvocateKhoj.com is not
                            warranted or guaranteed. Please use caution and common sense when using this site. Your use
                            of information on the site or materials linked from the site is at your own risk.</p>
                        <p>AdvocateKhoj.com makes every effort to verify that lawyers who subscribe to the Service are
                            licensed and in good standing with the local BAR at the time of registration. However,
                            AdvocateKhoj.com is unable to track, verify, or monitor the standing of each lawyer using
                            the Service. Therefore, AdvocateKhoj.com makes no representation regarding the status,
                            standing or ability of any lawyer or law firm that submits bids, or is listed through this
                            Web site.</p>
                        <p>Users are urged to make their own independent investigation and evaluation of any lawyer or
                            law firm being considered. The determination of the need for legal services and the choice
                            of a lawyer are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely on claims of
                            expertise, or on the cost of rendering the requested legal services.</p>
